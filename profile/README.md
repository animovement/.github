_animovement_ is an openâ€‘source R toolbox for analysing movement across space and time. It provides a modular, tidyverseâ€‘friendly ecosystem of packages that cover the whole workflowâ€”from importing raw tracking data to visualising and quantifying movement metrics. 

_animovement_ is designed for ethologists, behavioural ecologists, neuroscientists, biomechanicists and anyone who needs robust movement analysis tools. The suite follows a modular architecture, allowing you to pick just the components you need while still benefiting from a coherent, interoperable workflow.

## Packages
The *animovement* package consists of six core packages, each focused on a specific stage of the workflow:
